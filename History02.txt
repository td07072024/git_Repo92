The history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini (1870â€“1949) founded the Bank of Italy, in San Francisco.[14] In 1922, Bank of America, Los Angeles was established with Giannini as a minority investor. The two banks merged in 1928 and consolidated with other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country.[16]

In 1918, another corporation, Bancitaly Corporation, was organized by A. P. Giannini, the largest stockholder of which was Stockholders Auxiliary Corporation.[citation needed] This company acquired the stocks of various banks located in New York City and certain foreign countries.[citation needed]

In 1928, Giannini merged his bank with Bank of America, Los Angeles, headed by Orra E. Monnette. Bank of Italy was renamed on November 3, 1930, to Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association,[17] which was the only such designated bank in the United States at that time. Giannini and Monnette headed the resulting company, serving as co-chairs.
